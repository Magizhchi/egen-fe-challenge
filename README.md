# egen-fe-challenge
This was a programming challenge
Requirement :  A simple phone number formatter for multiple countries using angular2

This was implemented using MEAN Stack and angular2
To run the program:
1) Make sure node and mongoDB are installed correctly and running in your machine
2) Extract content of the folder
3) Run npm install
4) Run npm start
5) For tests run ‘npm run test-client’

The Formatter is implemented using pipes which makes it reusable anywhere within the project

If your facing error while launching the application try commenting out the copyfiles entry from package.json and manually copy angular2 and rxjs to the javascripts folder in public
